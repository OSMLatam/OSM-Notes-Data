# OSM-Notes-Data

JSON data files for OSM Notes Viewer and AI-assisted note resolution.

This repository contains pre-calculated analytics data exported from the OSM Notes Analytics data warehouse, optimized for consumption by web viewers and AI systems.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### Data Files

#### User Data (`data/users/`)

Individual JSON files for each OpenStreetMap user, organized in a hexadecimal subdirectory structure for optimal filesystem performance:

- **Structure**: `data/users/{hex1}/{hex2}/{hex3}/{user_id}.json`
- **Example**: `data/users/0/3/2/421938.json`
- **Format**: Hexadecimal hash-based 3-level directory structure (modulo 4096)
- **Purpose**: Provides detailed statistics per user including:
  - Notes created, resolved, and commented
  - Application usage (mobile vs desktop)
  - Resolution metrics and response times
  - Historical data by year/month
  - Contributor type information

**Why subdirectories?** With hundreds of thousands of user files, organizing them in subdirectories improves:
- Filesystem performance (faster directory listings)
- GitHub UI navigation (no truncation)
- Scalability for future growth (millions of users)

#### Country Data (`data/countries/`)

Individual JSON files for each country:

- **Structure**: `data/countries/{country_id}.json`
- **Purpose**: Country-level statistics including:
  - Notes by country
  - Resolution rates and metrics
  - Application usage patterns
  - Temporal resolution data

#### Index Files (`data/indexes/`)

Quick lookup files for efficient data discovery:

- **`users.json`**: Array of all users with basic statistics (sorted by activity)
- **`countries.json`**: Array of all countries with basic statistics
- **Purpose**: Enables fast user/country discovery without loading individual files

#### Metadata (`data/metadata.json`)

Export metadata including:
- Export timestamp
- Total counts (users, countries, notes)
- Data version information

#### GeoJSON Files

- **`countries.geojson.gz`**: Compressed GeoJSON with country boundaries
- **`maritimes.geojson.gz`**: Compressed GeoJSON with maritime boundaries
- **Purpose**: Geographic data for map visualization

#### CSV Files (`csv/notes-by-country/`)

**Purpose**: Provide context to AI systems for note resolution assistance.

These CSV files contain notes organized by country, formatted to help AI models understand:
- Note content and context
- Geographic distribution
- Resolution patterns
- Historical data for training/context

**Use Case**: When an AI system needs to assist in resolving OpenStreetMap notes, these files provide the necessary context about:
- What types of notes exist in each country
- Common resolution patterns
- Geographic and cultural context
- Historical resolution data

Files are named by country ID: `{country_id}_{country_name}.csv`

#### Other Files

- **`noteLocation.csv.zip`**: Compressed CSV with note locations (lat/lon coordinates)
- **`schemas/`**: JSON Schema files for data validation (copied from OSM-Notes-Analytics)
